My name is James Song, and I am currently a 4th year CS student at Western University that is set to graduate May 2026. I am primarily a game developer using Unity and C#, but I also have experience and created projects involving Python (AI), C++ (OpenGL), Java, and more!

Here are some things I am currently working on:
  - I am a contributor to the [NLIP](https://nlip-project.org/#/) open-source project, which provides a standard protocol for communication between different AI agents
  - A 2D pixel Roguelike dungeon crawler on Unity with dungeon generation similar to Dead Cells

And here are some things I have worked on in the past:
  - Simple parkour platformer ([Ninja Trials](https://phantom-xyz.itch.io/ninja-trials)) with rope swing mechanic and a camera system similar to the one in Hollow Knight (different camera zones and types) on Unity
  - Wave defense shooter ([Alien Blast Off](https://phantom-xyz.itch.io/alien-blast-off)) similar to Muffin Knight (collect a certain amount of power cells to pass a level, get a randomized weapon every time you collect a power cell)
  - Wave defense ([Scuba Warrior](https://phantom-xyz.itch.io/scuba-warrior)) with Terraria-like combat and boss battles
  - Collaborated on a pet care game using Java and JavaFX
  - Collaborated on a Metroidvania-like game where you must defeat computer viruses using SFML (C++)
